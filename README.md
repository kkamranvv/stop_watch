# Stop Watch
This is a simple, visually appealing stopwatch application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app lets users start, stop, and reset a timer with precision to the hundredths of a second. The clean, modern design includes large buttons and a responsive display, making it easy to use across various screen sizes. Key features include:

Start: Begins timing from zero or the last stopped time.
Stop: Pauses the current time, allowing you to resume from the same point.
Reset: Clears the timer and resets it back to 00:00:00.
This project is an excellent example of DOM manipulation and basic JavaScript timing functions.
